git clone https://github.com/iMshyam/ComIt.git
cd ComIt
python config.py

Windows:
___
install [Python]

if cmd doesn't understand python then you need to set environment variable 'python'

For setting environment variable open Windows Power-Shell and paste : [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python27", "User")

now download [this]
```sh
extract "ComIt-master"
open cmd as "ADMIN" 
run configWindows.py in cmd
#in my case(or the file is extracted in Downloads\ComIt-master)
#so i pasted it in cmd : cd %userprofile%\Downloads\ComIt-master\
#and then run : python configWindows.py
click on 'YES' when asked for adding Registry
restart cmd(no need to open as Admin)
#it's important to open cmd as admin and restart cmd

```
